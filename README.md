An approach to target detection is proposed based on a likelihood ratio test in which the unknown target strength is treated as known,
with strength chosen to correspond to a minimal level of detectability. For Gaussian distributions, this strength
typically corresponds to two or three sigmas. This detector is admissible, which means that there is no other
detector that is uniformly superior to it. The simplicity of the veritas detector permits closed-form solutions to
be derived for a variety of signal detection problems. In a series of numerical experiments, these simple detectors
are compared to traditional detectors, such as the locally most powerful detector and the generalized likelihood
ratio test detector.
